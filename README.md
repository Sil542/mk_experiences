It is recommended to use flask server for debugging purposes.

This repository uses the flask folder structure:

static: Assets like sound, models and pictures are stored in seperate folders

templates: The index.html is stored in this folder

!!DO NOT CHANGE THE STATIC FOLDER STRUCTURE WITHOUT NOTICING OTHER'S!!
