It is recommended to use flask server for debugging purposes.

This repository uses the flask folder structure:

static: Assets like sound, models and pictures are stored in seperate folders

templates: The index.html is stored in this folder

Please keep the file types as consistent as possible. For images use png. For sounds use mp3. For models use glb. For patt files, use .patt files.

!!DO NOT CHANGE THE STATIC FOLDER STRUCTURE WITHOUT NOTICING OTHER'S!!

Application description:

HTML/CSS/JS together with Ar.js module. Uses marker scanning to make a glb model pop out of marker. Storing the stories of multiple languages in json file.

Server description:
